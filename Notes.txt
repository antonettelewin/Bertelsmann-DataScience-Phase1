Lesson 7 - Visualizing Data
  http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/Histogram/
  Normal : graph is close to symetrical with one peak (bell shape)
  Binmodal : close to symetricals with two peaks (camel shape)
  Uniform : close to straight line
  
Lesson 10 - Central Tendency [Mod-30]
  Here is a short doc outlining Mean, Median, and Mode. http://tinyurl.com/measureOfCenter
  Mean : average (sum of all data values / number a data points)
  Median : middle number(if odd data set) or average of 2 middle number(if even data set)

Lesson 13
  IQR : Intergquartile Range
  IQR = Q3 - Q1
    Q2 = meadian
    Q1 = media of first half of data
    Q3 = Median of second half of data
  Outlier < Q1 - 1.5(IQR)  
  Outlier > Q3 + 1.5(IQR)
  Range = max value - min value
  zdeviation from mean = x[i] - mean
  average deviation = sum(x[i] - mean) / number of data points (n)
  sum of squares = sum of each deviate squared (squared deviation)
  variance : average of sum of squares
  standard deivation = squareroot(variance)


lesson 15

  z score : standard deviation from mean 
    [x(orginal value) - mean ]/deviation
 with z score you can create strandard normal disrtuction where the mewn is 0, the standard deviation is 1
 when calucating normal distrubriton you used the z score to find x

Lesson 20

Mean of each sample: 
1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4
