LESSON 24
Solution: Assign and Modify Variables
This is our solution to the previous quiz:
  # The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
  reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
  # The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
  rainfall = 5e6
  # decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
  rainfall *= .9
  # add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
  reservoir_volume += rainfall
  # increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
  # into the reservoir in the days following the storm
  reservoir_volume *= 1.05
  # decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
  reservoir_volume *= 0.95
  # subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
  # that's piped to arid regions.
  reservoir_volume -= 2.5e5 
  # print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)

Quiz: Which is denser, Rio or San Francisco?
  print(san_francisco_pop_density > rio_de_janeiro_pop_density)
  Note other solutions are possible, like the one below, but take a moment to make sure you understand 
  and appreciate the concise efficiency of the one line above!

    if (san_francisco_pop_density > rio_de_janeiro_pop_density):
          print (True)
      else:
          print (False)

Quiz: Fix the Quote
  Here are two different methods to fix the quote:

  # TODO: Fix this string!
  ford_quote = 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can\'t--you\'re right.'

  # TODO: Fix this string!
  ford_quote = "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."

Quiz: Write a Server Log Message
  Here are a couple of options for this one:

  print (username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + ".")

  OR

  message = username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + "."
  print(message)

Quiz: len
  name_length = len(given_name) + len(middle_names) + len(family_name) + 2

Quiz: Total Sales
  weekly_sales = int(mon_sales) + int(tues_sales) + int(wed_sales) + int(thurs_sales) + int(fri_sales)
  weekly_sales = str(weekly_sales)  #convert the type back!!
  print("This week's total sales: " + weekly_sales)

elements = {'hydrogen': {'number': 1, 'weight': 1.00794, 'symbol': 'H'},
            'helium': {'number': 2, 'weight': 4.002602, 'symbol': 'He'}}

Quiz: Adding Values to Nested Dictionaries
  elements = {'hydrogen': {'number': 1, 'weight': 1.00794, 'symbol': 'H'},
            'helium': {'number': 2, 'weight': 4.002602, 'symbol': 'He'}}
  # todo: Add an 'is_noble_gas' entry to the hydrogen and helium dictionaries
  # hint: helium is a noble gas, hydrogen isn't
  elements['hydrogen']['is_noble_gas'] = False
  elements['helium']['is_noble_gas'] = True
  print(elements['hydrogen']['is_noble_gas'])
print(elements['helium']['is_noble_gas'])


LESSON 25
#First Example - try changing the value of phone_balance
	phone_balance = 10
	bank_balance = 50

	if phone_balance < 10:
		phone_balance += 10
		bank_balance -= 10

	print(phone_balance)
	print(bank_balance)

#Second Example - try changing the value of number

	number = 145
	if number % 2 == 0:
		print("Number " + str(number) + " is even.")
	else:
		print("Number " + str(number) + " is odd.")

#Third Example - try to change the value of age
	age = 35

	# Here are the age limits for bus fares
	free_up_to_age = 4
	child_up_to_age = 18
	senior_from_age = 65

	# These lines determine the bus fare prices
	concession_ticket = 1.25
	adult_ticket = 2.50

	# Here is the logic for bus fare prices
	if age <= free_up_to_age:
		ticket_price = 0
	elif age <= child_up_to_age:
		ticket_price = concession_ticket
	elif age >= senior_from_age:

	else:
		ticket_price = adult_ticket

	message = "Somebody who is {} years old will pay ${} to ride the bus.".format(age, ticket_price)

Quiz Solution: Which Prize
	points = 174  # use this input to make your submission

	# write your if statement here
	if points >= 1 and points<=50 :
		result = "Congratulations! You won a wooden rabbit!"
		
	elif points >=151 and points<=180:
		result = "Congratulations! You won a wafer-thin mint!"
		
	elif points >=181 and points<=200:
		result = "Congratulations! You won a penguin!"
		
	else:
		result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."
	print(result)
	
	
	points = 174

	if points <= 50:
		result = "Congratulations! You won a wooden rabbit!"
	elif points <= 150:
		result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."
	elif points <= 180:
		result = "Congratulations! You won a wafer-thin mint!"
	else:
		result = "Congratulations! You won a penguin!"

	print(result)
	
	
Quiz: Guess My Number	
	# '''
	# You decide you want to play a game where you are hiding 
	# a number from someone.  Store this number in a variable 
	# called 'answer'.  Another user provides a number called
	# 'guess'.  By comparing guess to answer, you inform the user
	# if their guess is too high or too low.

	# Fill in the conditionals below to inform the user about how
	# their guess compares to the answer.
	# '''
	answer = 7
	guess = 3

	if answer > guess :
		result = "Oops!  Your guess was too low."
	elif answer < guess :
		result = "Oops!  Your guess was too high."
	elif answer == guess:
		result = "Nice!  Your guess matched the answer!"

	print(result)
	
	
Quiz: Tax Purchase	
	# '''
	# Depending on where an individual is from we need to tax them 
	# appropriately.  The states of CA, MN, and 
	# NY have taxes of 7.5%, 9.5%, and 8.9% respectively.
	# Use this information to take the amount of a purchase and 
	# the corresponding state to assure that they are taxed by the right
	# amount.
	# '''
	state = 'NY'
	purchase_amount = 132

	if state == 'CA' :
		tax_amount = .075
		total_cost = purchase_amount*(1+tax_amount)
		result = "Since you're from {}, your total cost is {}.".format(state, total_cost)

	elif state == 'MN' :
		tax_amount = .095
		total_cost = purchase_amount*(1+tax_amount)
		result = "Since you're from {}, your total cost is {}.".format(state, total_cost)

	elif state == 'NY' :
		tax_amount = .089
		total_cost = purchase_amount*(1+tax_amount)
		result = "Since you're from {}, your total cost is {}.".format(state, total_cost)

	print(result)
	
	
Quiz Solution: Using Truth Values of Objects
	points = 174

	points = 174  # use this input when submitting your answer

	# set prize to default value of None
	prize = None

	# use the value of points to assign prize to the correct prize name
	if points <= 50:
		prize = "wooden rabbit"
	elif 151 <= points <= 180:
		prize = "wafer-thin mint"
	elif points >= 181:
		prize = "penguin"

	# use the truth value of prize to assign result to the correct message
	if prize:
		result = "Congratulations! You won a {}!".format(prize)
	else:
		result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."

	print(result)
