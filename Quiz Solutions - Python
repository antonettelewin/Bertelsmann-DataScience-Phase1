Lesson 24    
Strings
  Strings in Python are shown as the variable type str. You can define a string with either double quotes " or single quotes '. 
    There are two ways to do this: 
      with backslash escaping: `ford_quote = 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can\'t--you\'re right.'`
      with double quotes: `ford_quote = "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."`
  
The len() function
  len() is a built-in Python function that returns the length of an object, like a string. 
    name_length = len(given_name + middle_names + family_name) + 2`. The `+2` accounts for the spaces in between each word.
    
 Type And Type Conversion
You have seen four data types so far:

int
float
bool
string

 Quiz: Which is denser, Rio or San Francisco?
print(san_francisco_pop_density > rio_de_janeiro_pop_density)
Note other solutions are possible, like the one below, but take a moment to make sure you understand and appreciate the concise efficiency of the one line above!

if (san_francisco_pop_density > rio_de_janeiro_pop_density):
    print (True)
else:
    print (False)
    
 Quiz: Fix the Quote
Here are two different methods to fix the quote:

# TODO: Fix this string!
ford_quote = 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can\'t--you\'re right.'

# TODO: Fix this string!
ford_quote = "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."
Quiz: Write a Server Log Message
Here are a couple of options for this one:


print (username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + ".")

OR

message = username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + "."
print(message)
Quiz: len
name_length = len(given_name) + len(middle_names) + len(family_name) + 2

Quiz: Total Sales
weekly_sales = int(mon_sales) + int(tues_sales) + int(wed_sales) + int(thurs_sales) + int(fri_sales)
weekly_sales = str(weekly_sales)  #convert the type back!!
print("This week's total sales: " + weekly_sales)
