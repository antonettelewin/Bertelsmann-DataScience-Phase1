LESSON 24
Solution: Assign and Modify Variables
This is our solution to the previous quiz:
  # The current volume of a water reservoir (in cubic metres)
  reservoir_volume = 4.445e8
  # The amount of rainfall from a storm (in cubic metres)
  rainfall = 5e6
  # decrease the rainfall variable by 10% to account for runoff
  rainfall *= .9
  # add the rainfall variable to the reservoir_volume variable
  reservoir_volume += rainfall
  # increase reservoir_volume by 5% to account for stormwater that flows
  # into the reservoir in the days following the storm
  reservoir_volume *= 1.05
  # decrease reservoir_volume by 5% to account for evaporation
  reservoir_volume *= 0.95
  # subtract 2.5e5 cubic metres from reservoir_volume to account for water
  # that's piped to arid regions.
  reservoir_volume -= 2.5e5 
  # print the new value of the reservoir_volume variable
print(reservoir_volume)

Quiz: Which is denser, Rio or San Francisco?
  print(san_francisco_pop_density > rio_de_janeiro_pop_density)
  Note other solutions are possible, like the one below, but take a moment to make sure you understand 
  and appreciate the concise efficiency of the one line above!

    if (san_francisco_pop_density > rio_de_janeiro_pop_density):
          print (True)
      else:
          print (False)

Quiz: Fix the Quote
  Here are two different methods to fix the quote:

  # TODO: Fix this string!
  ford_quote = 'Whether you think you can, or you think you can\'t--you\'re right.'

  # TODO: Fix this string!
  ford_quote = "Whether you think you can, or you think you can't--you're right."

Quiz: Write a Server Log Message
  Here are a couple of options for this one:

  print (username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + ".")

  OR

  message = username + " accessed the site " + url + " at " + timestamp + "."
  print(message)

Quiz: len
  name_length = len(given_name) + len(middle_names) + len(family_name) + 2

Quiz: Total Sales
  weekly_sales = int(mon_sales) + int(tues_sales) + int(wed_sales) + int(thurs_sales) + int(fri_sales)
  weekly_sales = str(weekly_sales)  #convert the type back!!
  print("This week's total sales: " + weekly_sales)

elements = {'hydrogen': {'number': 1, 'weight': 1.00794, 'symbol': 'H'},
            'helium': {'number': 2, 'weight': 4.002602, 'symbol': 'He'}}

Quiz: Adding Values to Nested Dictionaries
  elements = {'hydrogen': {'number': 1, 'weight': 1.00794, 'symbol': 'H'},
            'helium': {'number': 2, 'weight': 4.002602, 'symbol': 'He'}}
  # todo: Add an 'is_noble_gas' entry to the hydrogen and helium dictionaries
  # hint: helium is a noble gas, hydrogen isn't
  elements['hydrogen']['is_noble_gas'] = False
  elements['helium']['is_noble_gas'] = True
  print(elements['hydrogen']['is_noble_gas'])
print(elements['helium']['is_noble_gas'])
